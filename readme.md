# A3PAD
A hackpad based on the Apple ///. Undebatably the best design of the 80s. Case designed in Shapr3D.

## Fully modeled
Figured out some issues from last version, so yeah... mockup is more complete.
Essentially, I gave it some pizzaz and fixed some kinks in the Apple /// design. Yeah.

Not exactly ergonomic but it's... it's stylish enough? I guess?

## PCB
Schematic.

Not much else to say there. Tried keeping it compact.

## Firmware!!!
Uses KMK. It's pretty simple, so... ye. Shan't be TOO hard.
Encoder does volume. Press to mute.
OLED screen just for funsies. Might make a program to dynamically change it in the future. Will see.

## Production
The case top and main case are together in the same file. They're small enough, I hope.

## Bill Of Materials
Gotta know the materials part, I guess.

4x Cherry MX Falcons -- If needed I can absolutely take regular Cherry MX Reds.
4x DSA Keycaps
4x M3x16mm screws
4x M3x5x4 Heatset inserts
1x 0.91" 128x32 OLED Display
1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
1x XIAO RP2040
1x Case (fully 3d printed)

## Elsewise
Second attempt at a CAD design. Proudest work (low bar).
